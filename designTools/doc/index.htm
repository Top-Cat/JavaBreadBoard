<h1 align="center"><font face="VAG Round">Java BreadBoard Simulator: <br>
Chip Design Tools Help</font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial">These help pages are for the chip design tools. To go to
help on the breadboard simulator <a href="../../guide.html">click here</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The chip design tools provide the capability to create
custom chips for use with the breadboard simulator. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Using the chip design tools require that loading and
saving has been enabled. <a href="../../loadsave.html">Click here for details</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Custom </font><font face="Arial">chips can be opened in
the Java BreadBoard Simulator by selecting a Generic chip from the chip selection dialog box (click
Insert -&gt; Chip from the breadboard simulator to open the chip selector). On
doing so a file chooser dialog box will appear from which the chip file should
be selected.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Creating a New Chip</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">To create a new chip open the Chip Design Tools program
(applet or application). An option pane will
appear requesting that you select the type of chip editor that you wish to use.
You can get more help on the separate editors by clicking on the relevant link
below.</font></p>

Table Editor</a></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Loading / Saving Circuits with Generic Chips</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If generic chips are added to a breadboard and then the
circuit is saved the circuit file records the filename of all generic chips.
When the circuit is reloaded it attempts to find the generic chip files. If they
cannot be found the option will be given to locate the chip file. The filename stored is absolute so if the files are moved they will not be
automatically located.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Manually Modifying / Creating a Chip File</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">A chip is represented by a text file as a state transition
table with a number of headers which give the chip its characteristics. This
file can be created or edited using any standard text editor. At present there
is no facility to load into the chip editors chips which have been previously
created, so the only way in which chips can be modified is to manually change
the text file.</font></p>
