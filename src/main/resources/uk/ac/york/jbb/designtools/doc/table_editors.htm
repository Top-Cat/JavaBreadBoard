<h1 align="center"><font face="VAG Round">Truth Table Editor and State Table
Editor</font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial">Truth tables state for each input configuration the
corresponding output configuration. State tables are similar to truth tables
except there is the concept of an internal state. State tables give the output
values and next state for each configuration of input values and initial state.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On invoking the truth table or state table editors a
dialog box requests the number of input pins, output pins and in the case of the
state table editor, the number of internal states, for the chip. Once these
values have been selected press continue and the editor window will appear with
all of the input-state combinations already input.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">To change output values, simply click on the respective
cell. Clicking on cells toggles the value, so a '0' changes to a '1' and a '1'
to a '0'. To change the value for the next state click on the respective cell
and a combo-box containing all valid next states will appear. Click on the
correct state in the combo-box. Note that states are given in decimal (base 10)
values.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">When the chip is placed on the breadboard a panel on the
left states the label for each pin. To change pin labels in the table editors so
that the correct label is shown in the breadboard simulator double-click on the
table column headers. This will bring up an input dialog box into which the pin
label should be typed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The state table editor has an additional panel on the
right-hand side for giving the chip's initial state in which it will start on
power-up. When circuits are developed in hardware components which have state
normally start in a random state so it must be remembered that when any circuits
are translated from these tools into hardware that additional circuitry may be
needed to force the initial state. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The properties panel at the bottom of the editor should be
used for setting additional chip characteristics. For help on the components of
the properties panel <a href="properties_panel.htm">click here.</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Once the chip table has been completed the chip file is
saved by clicking File -&gt; Create Chip File. Doing so brings up a save dialog
box. Select the directory and filename and click Save. The file extension
&quot;.chp&quot; will automatically be added. In order to create chip files
loading and saving must have been enabled. <a href="../../loadsave.html">Click

<p><font face="Arial">Once the file has been saved the option is given to close
the editor. Remember that once the editor has been closed the chip cannot be
re-loaded into the editor and any changes will need to be made manually to the
chip file. Thus it is advisable to test the chip in the breadboard simulator
before closing the table editor.</font></p>
