<h1 align="center"><font face="VAG Round">Circuit Diagram Editor</font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial">Chip circuits can be developed by adding circuit
components to a workspace and wiring them together. This is done by the circuit
diagram editor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Logic components available in the circuit diagram editor
are AND gates, OR gates, and inverters. The toolbox also includes ground and VCC
connections for providing constant '0' and '1' values respectively and input and
output pins which map to pins on the chip. These components can be added to the
workspace by clicking the buttons in the toolbar or selecting the component from
the Insert menu. Holding the mouse pointer over the items in the toolbar causes
a tool-tip to appear which identifies the component. Having selected the
component it is placed on the workspace by clicking where it should be placed. A
ghost of the component follows the mouse pointer until the component is placed.
If you have accidentally selected a component that you don't want to place,
clicking the mouse pointer button on the left of the toolbar removes the
component. If an input or output pin is selected an input dialog will request a
label for the pin. This label is the label that will be used for the pin in the
breadboard simulator. Labels can also be added to any other part of the circuit
by clicking the 'A' button but this has no effect outside of the circuit diagram
editor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Once components have been placed on the workspace they can
be moved, deleted or, in the case of labels and pins, renamed. Components are
selected by clicking on them (while not in wiring mode). Once they have been
selected they can be moved, deleted or renamed by selecting the relevelant
option from the Edit menu. Components can also be moved by dragging them with
the mouse. If components are moved or deleted then all wires to which they
connect will be deleted.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">To wire components together you need to be in wiring mode.
Wiring mode is started by clicking on the wire button in the toolbox or
selecting Enter Wiring Mode from the Wire menu. The wiring mechanism for the
circuit diagram editor is the same as in the breadboard simulator. To start drawing
a wire click on the start position on the workspace. Move the mouse from this
point to draw out a wire. To place a bend in the wire click once and to
terminate the wire double-click. If a connection has been successfully made to a
component or another wire then a node will appear. To exit wiring mode click on
the pointer button in the toolbar or select Exit Wiring Mode from the wire menu.
The colour of the wire may be changed by selecting a colour from the wire menu. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The outputs of two components should never be connected
unless the outputs are tri-state buffers. At present the circuit diagram editor
does not support tri-state buffers, so checks are performed to ensure that
drawing a wire would not directly connect outputs. If this occurs the wire is
removed and an error message shown in the status bar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If the circuit diagram editor is not in wiring mode wires
can be selected by clicking on them. Once selected they may be deleted by
clicking the delete key or selecting delete from the Edit menu. If the deleted
wire is connected to others the the connected wires are also removed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The properties panel at the bottom of the editor should be
used for setting additional chip characteristics. For help on the components of
the properties panel <a href="properties_panel.htm">click here.</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Once the chip diagram has been completed the chip file is
saved by clicking File -&gt; Create Chip File. Doing so brings up a save dialog
box. Select the directory and filename and click Save. The file extension
&quot;.chp&quot; will automatically be added. In order to create chip files
loading and saving must have been enabled. <a href="../../loadsave.html">Click
here for more information.</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Once the file has been saved the option is given to close
the editor. Remember that once the editor has been closed the chip cannot be
re-loaded into the editor and any changes will need to be made manually to the
chip file. Thus it is advisable to test the chip in the breadboard simulator
before closing the table editor.</font></p>
